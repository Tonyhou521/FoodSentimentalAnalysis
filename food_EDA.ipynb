The development has been hailed as a landmark moment across the meat industry.\\n\\nThe ‚Äúchicken bites‚Äù, produced by the US company Eat Just, have passed a safety review by the Singapore Food Agency and the approval could open the door to a future when all meat is produced without the killing of livestock, the company said.\\n\\nThe cells for Eat Just‚Äôs product are grown in a 1,200-litre bioreactor and then combined with plant-based ingredients. Initial availability would be limited, the company said, and the bites would be sold in a restaurant in Singapore. The product would be significantly more expensive than conventional chicken until production was scaled up, but Eat Just said it would ultimately be cheaper.\\n\\nThe cells used to start the process came from a cell bank and did not require the slaughter of a chicken because cells can be taken from biopsies of live animals. The nutrients supplied to the growing cells were all from plants.\\n\\nThe small scale of current cultured meat production requires a relatively high use of energy and therefore carbon emissions. But once scaled up its manufacturers say it will produce much lower emissions and use far less water and land than conventional meat.\\n\\nThis is news that gives us a glimpse of a possible future in which animals are not hurt in the pursuit of food, but where meat is available for those who value it.\\n\\nSource: The Guardian (link in bio)\\n\\n#singapore #meat #sustainability #science #labgrownmeat #food #futurefood #chicken #chickennuggets', 'So true!

This is the conversation I want to be driving on this page. As the current generation of farmers/ranchers, raising the next generation of farmers/ranchers, it is my responsibility and DESIRE to create discussion around topics like this. This is also why I advocate so passionately for the Ag industry, because the people who want to remove animal protein aren‚Äôt thinking about things like this. They don‚Äôt understand that the future of food isn‚Äôt about replacing or negating - its about choices, innovation and working together. Which is exactly what was addressed at Agrivision 2021. \\n\\nAgrivision 2021 is a virtual global conference I attended last week that brought together key stakeholders to address food system challenges and discuss opportunities to solve them. I heard insight about new food innovations, there were guest speakers on the economics of sustainability, we explored how to feed animals in such a way that we could get more out of them (help them reach their genetic potential), and we learned about the future of farming, - alternative proteins and protein production systems. There was a story about a dairy farm in Finland who is actually using manure to power cars in their city !!!!

We should all be trying to eat fewer animal-based foods - but avoiding them completely isn't viable for some - whether for health, financial or cultural reasons.\\n.\\nBut we don't need to completely cut animal products out of our diets to make a huge difference. Research shows that some farms have much less environmental impact than others: for example, 'low-impact' beef farms release 12x less greenhouse gas emissions use 50x less land than high-impact beef farms.\\n.\\nSo if we all halved our consumption of animal products, and bought those products only from 'low-impact' producers, it would have up 70% of the environmental benefits of avoiding animal products entirely. The challenge, unfortunately, is that at present it's hard for consumers to know which products come from low impact farms - but better sustainability labelling on products could make things easier in the future.\\n.\\nLearn more about high-impact and low-impact producers at foodunfolded.co/low-impact-beef \\nSource: J.

Lab-grown meat is often known as cultured meat or clean meat produced from slaughtered animals.\\xa0\\xa0\"Cultured meat refers to the concept of meat (which includes muscle cells, fat cells, connective tissue, blood, and other components) produced via cell culture, rather than from a whole slaughtered animal.\" (New-Harvest, Org). Sustainable startups have been rapidly looking for ways to create cultured beef, poultry, or fish meat. The ethics behind lab-grown meat, though, still revolve around slaughtering an animal to have its cells.\\n-\\n-\\nProponents of lab-grown meat have argued that cellular agriculture provides a significant reduction of environmental impact from meat production and the risk of infectious diseases transmitted from animals to humans (Eco-Business). A study in 2011 found that cultured meat (lab-grown) can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 78-96% and require 7-45% less energy and 82-96% less water. However, other recent studies have shown that lab-grown meat\\'s environmental impacts could be higher than those of livestock in the long term.\\xa0\\xa0Other research has shown that with animal immune systems, their bodies are naturally able to protect them against infections. However, with cell culture meat having a nutrient-rich quality, bacteria can multiply faster than animal cells. This would require high levels of sterility to prevent the meat from having bacteria. Not only that, but much of cellular agriculture would require plastics for packaging and production, which is already a raising debate.\\n-\\n-\\nIn modern agriculture, animals contribute to recycling large amounts of plant waste that humans cannot consume, creating fertilizer for the land. Replacing animals out of the environment would create long-term environmental degradation if they aren\\'t in their ecosystems. For me, I am still grasping between both sides of arguments, but I question whether or not this is sustainable in the long-term for the planet. Do you think cellular / lab-grown meat is sustainable or even ethical?\\n-\\n-\\n#labgrownmeat #meat #cellularmeat #cellularagriculture #regenerativeagriculture', 'As you know, I love dogs.

Alleine dieses starke Bev√∂lkerungswachstum sorgt daf√ºr, dass selbst bei gleichbleibendem Pro-Kopf-Fleischkonsum die Gesamtmenge an ben√∂tigtem Fleisch √ºber die Jahrzehnte enorm steigt. Allerdings steigt nicht nur die Bev√∂lkerung, sondern auch der Pro-Kopf-Fleischkonsum rasant und stellt uns (neben den offensichtlichen ethischen Problemen) auch vor diverse √∂kologische und weltgesundheitliche Probleme.üåéü•©‚öïÔ∏è\\n‚†Ä\\nWie die hier abgebildete Grafik illustriert, betrug der durchschnittliche globale Pro-Kopf-Fleischkonsum in 1961 etwa 23 kg pro Jahr. Das ergab damals einen globalen Gesamtfleischkonsum von etwa 82 Millionen Tonnen. In den Folgejahren stieg der Pro-Kopf-Fleischkonsum j√§hrlich kontinuierlich an und erreichte (je nach Quelle) im Zeitraum zwischen 2013 und 2015 einen vorl√§ufigen H√∂chstwert von etwa 43 kg pro Person, der in den Folgejahren auch nicht mehr merklich anstieg und laut @statistisches.bundesamt auch in 2018 in etwa bei diesem Wert lag. (Destatis, 2021: Global animal farming, meat production and consumption).

To cultivate meat cells, researchers currently rely on a less-than-ideal growing media - fetal bovine serum (FBS). This is sourced from bovine fetuses which opposes the ethical aims of cultured meat.\\n\\nIn a new study, researchers develop a low-cost, animal-free media called Beefy-9 to replace FBS in cell-cultured meat. By adapting a previous medium (B8) with recombinant albumin, the team have provided an opportunity to accelerate the field and bring cultivated meat one step closer to your plate.\\n\\nThis research was published in Communications Biology.

So where does it go?\\n\\nOne third of global food production equates to about 1.3 billion tonnes of food that is lost or wasted every year. In most parts of the world, the amount of food lost before it reaches consumers is relatively comparable. The stage of the food supply chain in which waste occurs however, varies considerably. In production stages, natural conditions like unpredictable weather or human-induced conditions like a sharp drop in prices might force farmers to discard their crops at the farm level. During the transportation stages, more losses occur where infrastructure like refrigerated transportation is lacking, or where poor planning and logistics causes food to spoil during transit. At the processing and packaging stage, excessive trimming to attain certain aesthetics or technical malfunctions can lead to more food unnecessarily leaving the supply chain. When food reaches our shops and restaurants, it may also be discarded because of incorrect packaging, overstocking, or a lack of consumer demand. Finally, when it reaches our homes, some countries will throw as much as half of it into the trash simply because we overbought, overcooked, or just plain forgot to eat it.\\n\\nUndoubtedly, rewiring the food system for less wasteful supply chains requires systemic change, but we can all do something about it. Informing ourselves about the issue, being mindful about the amount of food we purchase, and holding businesses and governments accountable for their actions can all make a significant difference.\\n\\nWhat do you do to minimise your food waste?\\n\\nText by @madhurarrao\\nGraphics by @cait__mack\\nReference: FAO (2011)\\nFoodUnfolded is co-funded by @eiteu, a body of the EU üá™üá∫\\n\\n#foodunfolded #discoverfood #foodfacts #knowyourfood  #foodnetwork #foodchoices\\n#foodquality #foodwaste #foodsystem #stopfoodwasteday #stopfoodwaste #savefood #foodwasteprevention #foodwastewarriors', \"üèÜüçî A plant based burger to win them all!

Alle voedingsstoffen die we als mens nodig hebben om te bloeien en groeien vind je in het plantenrijk (zelfs vitamine b12 wordt tegenwoordig toegevoegd aan bijvoorbeeld soya melk).\\n2. Zelfs dieren hebben hun b12 te danken aan de toevoeging aan hun voer (niet omdat ze het zelf nog hebben).\\n3. De gezonde Omega 3 vetten in vis zijn te danken aan de algen die ze eten (of kleinere vissen die dan weer algen hebben gegeten). De prote√Øne in een koe of kip hebben ze te danken aan het voer wat ze eten (planten). Met planten halen we dus die voedingsstoffen direct uit de bron. En we skippen de stresshormonen, antibiotica en andere onnodige toevoegingen.\\n4. Calcium, ijzer, antioxidanten, vitamine c. Planten bevatten enorme bommetjes van deze belangrijke nutri√´nten, vitamines en mineralen. En nog veel meer dan dat. Non heem ijzer uit planten nemen we minder snel op maar distribueren we daarentegen beter. En het zorgt niet, in tegenstelling tot heem ijzer voor kleine ontstekingen in ons lichaam. \\n5. Een paar van de beste sporters ter wereld zijn plantbased. Denk aan Lewis Hamilton, Serena Williams, Novak Djokovic, Rich Roll maar ook Arnold Swarzenegger, Jackie Chan en Mike Tyson. Veel top atleten merkten dat hun prestaties nog meer verbeterden door een plantbased dieet. Check √©cht de docu @gamechangersmovie \\n6. De ei en zuivelindustrie is (bijna altijd) vreselijk (zie ook eerdere post). Koeien zijn continu zwanger anders geven ze geen melk, kalfjes vrijwel direct bij de moeder weggehaald, stiertjes vaak gedood omdat ze geen melk kunnen geven. Haantjes bij geboorte ook. Eten dat niet geleden heeft geeft zoveel meer voldoening #futurefood\\n7. Het is de aller beste en effectiefste manier om je impact te verkleinen op de wereld.\\n8. Het is een feest en genot om te eten. Veel minder consessies dan je denkt. Je eet veel gevarieerder en kan nog steeds de lekkerste romige sauzen maken (cashewnoten is the secret ingredient). En het HOEFT NIET 100% perfect. \\n10. Je voelt je er heel erg lekker door. Mentaal, fysiek. En gezond!

But while we‚Äôre are able to graze the supermarket shelves at our convenience any time of year, some lesser considered players in the food system don‚Äôt have it so easy. Birds aren‚Äôt usually first on the list when we think of pollinators, but they do play a significant role in agricultural production through their incidental pollinating habits.

Sugar consumption has almost tripled in many countries in the space of a century. The problem is that we don‚Äôt always notice how much sugar we consume, because this ingredient has been hiding for decades in most soft drinks and packaged foods ‚Äì both sweet and savoury.\\n\\nIn Europe, Switzerland leads with an average of 126 grams (around 29 teaspoons) of sugar per day. The trend in sugar consumption in Western countries reached its peak in the 1970s and has been declining slightly since then, thanks also to greater awareness of the effects that excessive consumption can have on one‚Äôs weight and therefore health. However, today the consumption record is held by lower income countries, and it is no coincidence: as consumption has decreased in Western countries, the sugar industry (and in particular thei industry of sugary drinks) has started advertising more aggressively in countries where citizens do not always have the financial resources and adequate access to information to follow a healthier diet.

However, the evidence behind other theories looking at sugar‚Äôs links to other health issues ‚Äì addictions, inflammation, dibaetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease ‚Äì is still considered low or insufficient by public health institutions.\\n\\nIndeed current nutrition science still faces many challenges. Because of ethical limitations, scientists often have to carry out observational studies: they ask people about what they eat normally and then follow up with them to see which people go on to develop some diseases. But when you do this kind of research, it‚Äôs really hard to unpack one factor from the rest of a person‚Äôs lifestyle: for example, scientists can‚Äôt be sure whether sugar intake is causing the disease instead of smoking or lack of exercise ‚Äì or everything combined. Also, participants often don‚Äôt report very accurately what they eat, making the scientific conclusions imprecise. And since many studies can only deal with small groups of volunteers, it is hard to draw conclusions on the impact of certain foods on a wide population.\\n\\nAnimals studies too are helpful to identify new directions for research on humans, but they are poor predictors of human reactions, and the evidence coming from them is often considered ‚Äúlow‚Äù. The gold standard of scientific research would be ‚Äúrandomised controlled trials‚Äù on big cohorts of humans.

Tofu can be an easy alternative for many meat dishes. It‚Äôs great when making curries. Make sure to buy extra firm tofu. Tempeh is another great alternative and even healthier than tofu as it has probiotics in it. I love using tempeh for sandwiches and salads. Beans, lentils and chickpeas are great substitutes as they are very high in protein! Seitan is another great option as it is very high in protein and has meaty texture. It can be used in curries and stir fries in replacement of meat. Portobello mushrooms are very low in calories and have meaty texture. Great option for sandwiches. Plant-based meats are also a great alternative. Though they are processed foods, they tend to be still low in saturated fat and have no dietary cholesterol in them.

Over the past few decades, our Body Mass Indexes - a measure that uses our height and weight to work out if our weight is healthy - have grown steadily, and in some places, exponentially. There are several doubts around the accuracy of BMI as a predictor of health, because it does not account for body fat percentage or body fat distribution, and it was created with data from only white Europeans. However, its increase across populations around the world is a fact. Several studies have shown that citizens of countries with the highest levels of obesity tend to have a higher daily caloric intake and a more sedentary life. Excess weight is too often interpreted as a lack of discipline and control on the part of the individual. However, access to a healthy diet is often limited by factors such as education, lack of accessible healthy and nutritious food, cultural traditions, and the promotion of junk food by big distribution retailers. We can‚Äôt leave this burden to individuals: we need policies that can level the access to a healthy and varied diet. \\n\\nText by @silvialazzaris Graphic by @cait__mack FoodUnfolded is co-funded by @eiteu, a body of the EU üá™üá∫\\n\\n#foodunfolded #discoverfood #foodfacts\\n#knowyourfood #foodchoices #foodquality\\n#foodwatch #knowwhatyoueat #consciouseating #obesity #health #bmi', \"The price has fallen from $280,000 per serving to just $3.90\\n‚Ä¢ Israeli start-up Future Meat Technologies has built the world's first industrial-scale cultured meat production facility\\\\\\n‚Ä¢ Future Meat Technologies will produce 1,000 pounds of lab-grown chicken, pork, or lamb per day. \\n‚Ä¢ The company says it can now produce four ounces of cultured chicken breast for $3.90.

Through countless generations of environmental and genetic trial and error, plants, animal, fungi, bacteria, and other organisms have all evolved and adapted to become unique pieces of the natural global puzzle. Each playing a crucial role, each serving a distinct ecological function. Without biodiversity, our ecological systems become weak, fractured, and fragile to change. Changes that our planet is now experiencing at an unprecedented rate and severity. \\n\\nBut since the intensification of our agricultural systems, biodiversity quickly become a second priority for us. Through decades of favouring quantity of output over an environmentally considered farming approach, we‚Äôve been slowly decimating our natural and agricultural biodiversity. From around 7,000 plant species once used in agricultural systems, we‚Äôre down to a meagre 30 crop species making up around 90% of the calories in our diets. \\n\\nThough it served as a short-term solution to food security, intensification led to a disproportional focus on a select few crops and livestock species. Not only has this approach resulted in degraded and polluted systems, huge reductions in natural biodiversity through land clearing and associated agricultural practices, but it‚Äôs also failed to solve the grand problem of global food security - an issue that is now recognised to be far more closely linked to unequal distribution chains and far less to the amount of food we produce. \\n\\nThe big question is, with a growing population and mouths to feed, where do we go from here? \\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nText by @oliverfredriksson \\nGraphics by @cait__mack\\nFoodUnfolded is funded by @eiteu, a body of the EU üá™üá∫\\n\\n#foodunfolded #discoverfood #foodfacts #knowyourfood #foodnetwork #foodchoices #foodquality\\n#foodwatch #knowwhatyoueat #consciouseating #biodiversity #agriculture #foodsecurity #calories', 'üí• Spannende Neuigkeiten: Orthomol arbeitet jetzt mit @isaac_nutrition zusammen! ü§ù Mehr Infos zu diesem tollen Startup findet Ihr unter dem Link in unserem Profil. üîó \\n#OrthomolInnovations #isaacnutrition #startup #insectprotein #futurefood', \"You don't need to own a large field to grow or harvest your own food.

It's the equatorial regions of the earth where coffee is most easily grown. The Canary Islands (Spain) and The Azores (Portugal) lie right outside of it but yet, due to their mild temperatures throughout the year and fertile lava soils are the only European regions with coffee plantations.\\n\\nThe largest and main commercial plantations are located in the Agaete Valley, in the island of Gran Canaria. Here, coffee is grown amongst mangos and avocados, crops that, like coffee, were brought by European colonisers as they stopped in the Canary Islands from South America on their way to Europe in the 19th century. \\n\\nFive tonnes of coffee are grown every year on around 10 hectares of land, a negligible amount compared to coffee plantations in South America or Sub-Saharan Africa. For this reason, the coffee doesn't get exported and is only sold to visitors at a high price caused mainly by the use of manual labour and scarce water resources.\\n\\nSince the business model of European-grown coffee depends on being unique and hard to find, it is unlikely to see a large expansion in its production and hence more competitive prices. So if you would like to try the coffee of the Canary Islands or the Azores yourself, you will have to plan a visit to one of these Atlantic Islands and visit the plantations! \\n\\nDo you see benefits do you see in growing coffee in Europe?

There is no denying that using fertilisers helped us expand our agriculture to what it is today, especially the use of synthetic fertilisers. Phosphorus and nitrogen fertilisers are some of the most commonly used ones. To the extent that roughly half of our population is fed by plants grown with synthetic nitrogen fertilisers.  Synthetic nitrogen fertilisers are created through the conversion from atmospheric nitrogen, which plants aren't able to use, to a reactive form of nitrogen, that plants can use, creating a supplement to the naturally occurring reactive nitrogen in the soil. \\nBut more fertiliser does not automatically mean higher yields for farmers. The over-application of fertiliser creates environmental problems. Applying too little or no fertiliser can also lead to issues, for example, the expansion of agricultural land into natural habitats and a corresponding loss of biodiversity. What's needed is the efficient management of fertilisers. In combination with other land and water management techniques, we would be able to improve yields consistently and decrease their effects on natural habitats, waterways, and many more.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nSource: Our World in Data (2013, 2021), Phalan and Green (2014)\\nGraphics by @cait__mack\\nFoodUnfolded is co-funded by @eiteu, a body of the EU \\n\\n#foodunfolded #farming #futurefarming #fertiliser #fertilizer #nitrogen #modernfarming #crops #knowyourfood #howitsmade #biodiversity #crophealth\", 'Spoons are some of the oldest utensils that we still use to this day.

But how often do you stop to consider how the cocoa was produced? The European chocolate market holds a value of around ‚Ç¨53 billion, yet profits in the cacao supply chain are notably one sided. The harsh reality is one in which many of the farmers that grow Europe‚Äôs cacao, have never tasted or seen chocolate for themselves. It‚Äôs a trade system that permits even the largest producers to profit off unsustainably low farmgate prices ‚Äì prices that drive markets for exploitation, rampant child labour, and environmentally damaging farm practices. With most cocoa plantations also owned by smallholders, farmers have struggled to find the leverage needed to negotiate higher farmgate prices in order to redirect much need profits back to growers. A 2018 True Price audit of CoÃÇte d‚ÄôIvoire‚Äôs cocoa industry ‚Äì responsible for ~40% of global cacao production - revealed that only 7% of all farmers currently earn a ‚Äòliving income‚Äô. To make matters worse, the cacao market is notoriously volatile, leading to even less stability for the majority of Ivoirian farmers and their families depending on cacao as a primary source of income.\\n\\nThe 2020/21 season however, might see the tides turning in favour of farmers. A recent partnership between CoÃÇte d‚ÄôIvoire and Ghana ‚Äì  collectively accounting for more than 60% of global cacao ‚Äì will see a ‚ÄòLiving Income Differential‚Äô (LID) added to all farmgate prices for the season ahead. The agreed LID adds an extra $400USD/tonne on top of all main crop sales, in a bid to place more money in the hands of farmers. Here are a few ways that the LID could impact the farmers that grow your cacao - or read more about the realities behind cacao production in our own @marikipedia's interview with Fairtrade Belgium's director, and Regional Cocoa Manager at Fairtrade Africa at foodunfolded.co/FairtradeCocoa\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nFoodUnfolded is funded by @eiteu, a body of the EU üá™üá∫\\n#foodunfolded #whatthefact #cocoa #chocolate #farmers #farmworkers #labour #cocoafarmers #cocoaproduction #agriculture #farmwork #essentialworkers #farmworkersrights #laborrights\", 'Voor lunch üå± Seaweed wraps van @seamorefood üëâ spannenddd!!! #zeewier #seawead #futurefood #wraps #seamore #musttry', 'Flashback to a very distinctive Yunnan delicacy, bamboo worms Á´πËô´. #yunnanfood #eatinginsects #edibleinsects', 'Plenny Shake Chai Latte is here! ‚òïÔ∏è\\n\\nIt‚Äôs creamy, full of Chai spice flavour, and with a nice sweetness to it.

Why antlers didn't quite matter as much as meat, and how when you are a consumer of meat, there can be no qualms or squeamishness about getting blood on your own hands and conscience.\\n\\nShe saw Papa load the gun and set it up. She heard Papa tell her that hunting is not a sport. She tried her best to understand when Papa explained that killing means death, and once dead, means gone. With a seriousness beyond her years, she was silent and focused as she watched her father spot, aim, and shoot.\\n\\nOne bullet, one clean shot, calculated to ensure the buck never even saw it coming. It's the least any hunter could do to appreciate the life he gave up so others can eat. She walked up to the deer and with her own two eyes and tiny hands, saw and felt him. Still.\\n\\nIn time she will understand the complexity of emotions that come with hunting. The philosophy behind it, and the different types of hunters that exist. With that, she will feel the backlash from those that oppose hunting, and struggle with the arguments for and against it.\\n\\nBut there is time for that yet.

Well, because along with other pollinators, bees play an invaluable role on our planet ‚Äì from being an integral part of land-based ecosystems to sustaining human agricultural systems. To give you some idea of just how reliant we are on them, imagine 1/3 of your breakfast, lunch, or dinner disappearing before your eyes. That 1/3 is roughly how much of our global food supply we would lose without the help of bees and other animal pollinators keeping our ecosystems functioning. In fact, they‚Äôre so crucial, that in 2019, bees were declared the most important species on Earth.\\n.\\nUnfortunately, recent years have painted a grim picture for pollinators. Practices associated with large-scale modern farming, such as widespread land clearing and the use of agrichemicals, have all contributed to a steep decline in pollinators. The loss of pollinators threatens not only the health and diversity of Earth‚Äôs ecosystems, but also global food security, billions of dollars worth of crops each year, and millions of jobs in associated agricultural industries.\\n.\\nIn many regions around the world, farmers are already feeling the effects. Many farms are now relying on commercial paid pollination - where bees are transported specifically to farms, so they can pollinate an orchard or crop. In China‚Äôs Sichuan Province, however, the losses are so severe that farmers have resorted to the unique practice of pollinating their orchards by hand.\\n.\\nRead the full story at http://foodunfolded.co/handpollination, or learn more about how you can support bees at http://foodunfolded.co/supportbees\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nGraphics by @cait__mack\\nArticles by: Molly Melvin\\nFoodUnfolded is co-funded by @eiteu, a body of the EU üá™üá∫\\n\\n#foodunfolded #discoverfood #foodfacts #knowyourfood  #foodnetwork #foodchoices\\n#foodquality #foodwatch #bee #worldbeeday #humblebee #beeday #pollinators #farm #farmers', \"It's not just wild bees that pollinate flowers!

We know that agriculture is one of the biggest contributors to carbon emissions, loss of biodiversity, destruction of natural habitats and consumption of freshwater, but what can be done to minimise all those major ecological problems without reducing crop production? \\n.\\nA group of scientists at Cambridge University has proposed a solution of radically redesigning the geography of global agriculture by identifying the best possible places to grow barley, maize, rice, soy beans, wheat and other crops, and relocating them there. The study, \"Relocating cropland could drastically reduce the environmental impacts of global food production\", published in Nature last month, argues that much of the environmental damage caused by agriculture is due to crops being grown in locations that are unsuitable because of their adverse weather, geology, soil or air quality, and other factors.\\n.\\nIf the global agricultural map was redesigned by relocating those crops to more productive locations, yields would increase and unproductive farmland could return to nature in order to sequester, rather than emit carbon. The study suggests that production of barley, rapeseed, soybean, sunflower and wheat should be concentrated in the Mid West of the US, and maize, millet, soybean and rice in part of the Sahel region. Rapeseed and soybean production could be increased in northeastern China, and maize, rice and soybean in northeastern China, replacing unproductive farmland in Europe and India that could then be  allowed to regenerate. The impact could be as dramatic as cutting the current carbon footprint of global crop production by 71%, and its biodiversity and irrigation water footprints by 87% and 100% respectively. \\n.\\n#design climateemergency #foodproduction #futurefarming #futurefood @nature_the_journal #earthday\\n.\\nPhotography by SCOTTCHAN, Shutterstock (Modern Farmer)', \"Ever wonder what it really means for a food product to be certified as 'EU Organic'?

Gates didn‚Äôt stop there. \\n\\nAs part of his effort to make the world vegan, Bill Gates along with PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel invested in Hampton Creek Foods (now called Eat Just), a food-tech startup company working on plant protein-based egg substitutes.\\n\\nDuring a question and answer session with MIT Technology Review, when asked if he thinks plant-based and lab-grown meats could be the full solution to the protein problem globally, even in poor nations, Gates responded saying: ‚ÄúSo no, I don‚Äôt think the poorest 80 countries will be eating synthetic meat. I do think all rich countries should move to 100% synthetic beef.‚Äù\\n\\nNow, as the battle against climate change rages on, investors are also paying attention to the space. In the last two years alone, investors have poured about $2 billion into the space, according to Crunchbase data. Tech startups like Eat Just is also working to create the world‚Äôs first-to-market meat made from animal cells. Eat Just CEO Josh Tetrick said his vision is to make lab-grown meat available everywhere from Michelin-star restaurants to street vendors and fast food chains.\\n\\n#startuppakistan #billgates #labgrownmeat #planet', 'Cricket empanadas by üì∏@bugs4beginners.

They are made by a small local business based in Footscray.

They offer pay-it-forward options with meals donated to street kitchens helping those that need food.

I think a meal delivery like this would be a helpful gift that can be tucked away into the freezer for later. \\n\\nThere are a multitude of reasons why people of all ages use these services, plus meal deliveries have been around way longer than you might think (like ancient Roman times and probably older!).

Chances are ‚Äòlow trophic‚Äô species like seaweed, sea squirts or shellfish weren‚Äôt first on your list - but they should be. In the wild, eating top predators is almost always more costly for both the environment and our wallets than eating species from lower trophic levels. When it comes to fish farming, however, it gets a little more complicated. \\n\\nTake salmon as an example (a naturally high trophic species): today, farmed salmon are fed a man-made and largely vegetarian diet, with around 70% of feed ingredients typically coming from plant-based sources. In theory, this largely plant-based diet reduces the trophic level of farmed salmon.\\n\\nBut despite this artificially lowered trophic level, higher level species like salmon are still naturally built to require higher levels of energy than lower trophic level species. This means they still need more food per kilogram of fish, regardless of where that energy comes from. While developments in aquaculture feed have seen improved feed conversion ratios (meaning less food is needed to produce more fish), fish feed still often accounts for over half of the total aquaculture production costs and is further contributing to land clearing to produce this feed. On the other hand, low-trophic species require only a fraction of the energy input to grow into a product that we can eat - cutting both costs and the resources needed to grow our food.\\n\\nWhile lower-trophic species generally need much less energy to grow compared with traditionally farmed species like salmon, farming some lower-trophic species can come with additional benefits. If designed correctly, both bivalve and algae farms can actually positively impact the environment around them ‚Äì all while producing nutritious food.\\n\\nRead the full article at foodunfolded.com or by clicking the link in our bio\\n\\nArticle by Oliver Fredriksson \\nGraphic by @cait__mack\\nFoodUnfolded is co-funded by @eiteu, a body of the European Union üá™üá∫\\n\\n#foodunfolded #discoverfood #foodfacts #knowyourfood #foodnetwork #foodchoices\\n#foodquality #foodwatch #knowwhatyoueat #aquaculture #fishfarming #environmentalimpact #climatenews', 'Have you ever tried ùò¢ùò≥ùò≥ùò∞ùòª ùò≥ùò∞ùò´ùò∞ (aka: red rice)?

On a commodity-basis, beef and cattle are responsible for most of the emissions. In terms of activities, most emissions depend on feed production and processing, but also enteric emissions (flatulence released by the animals).\\n.\\nHowever, the way meat and dairy are produced can result in very different emissions levels. For the same type of animal product, high impact producers can release up to 12 times more CO2 than low impact producers. Only 25% of beef farms contribute over half of all beef-related environmental damage.\\n.\\nThat is why a carbon tax, in order to be fair, should take into account not just the type of product, but also the type of production.\\n.\\nNevertheless, even animal products produced by the most environmentally friendly farms have a greater environmental impact than the environmentally ‚Äúworst\" vegetables and fruits.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nSource: Poore and Nemecek (2018), FAO\\nGraphics: @voozu\\nText: @silvialazzaris\\nFoodunfolded is funded by @eiteu, a body of the EU\\xa0üá™üá∫\\n\\n#foodunfolded #carbontax #animalproducts #livestock #greenhousegases #emissions #meat #dairy #co2 #sustainability #vegetables #fruits #environmentallyfriendly', \"The science is clear, and there's no opt-out: we all need to improve the sustainability of our diets.\\n.\\nMovements like Veganuary are great for raising awareness of plant-based diets, and for encouraging people to try one on for size.

But the ecological principles that guide life in these two scenes are exactly the same. There‚Äôs a balance that needs to be met - between plants, animals and their physical surroundings. This balance is key to that entire system being able to function healthily and to continue to thrive for generations to come. This is a balance many agricultural producers have been artificially upholding for years.\\n\\nOver time, we‚Äôve shaped our agricultural systems to give us maximum control over our natural environments in order to grow what we want, in the way we want, and in quantities we want. We‚Äôve cut back on the diversity of species, raised our land‚Äôs dependancy on human sourced inputs like nutrients and water, and cleared more land to upscale productions. And whether we like it or not, to some extent these systems have served their purpose for keeping us fed. But times are changing. Growing seasons are becoming less predictable around the world and these highly specialised ‚Äòone species - one process - one product‚Äô farms that we rely on are vulnerable.

Here‚Äôs what they found:\\n\\nüß† Higher education attainment was causally related to delayed onset of Alzheimer‚Äôs and increased cortical surface area and thickness.\\n\\nüß†Total and LDL-cholesterol levels were causally associated with amyloid plaques and lower hippocampal volume.\\n\\nüß†Diastolic blood pressure was casually associated with vascular damage. \\n\\nOut of these, education attainment, which is a proxy of cognitive reserve, had the strongest association. This doesn‚Äôt mean that other lifestyle factors such as dietary patterns, exercise and stress are not important, but that the study was not powered to find significance in all of the factors, and what stood out were education, cholesterol and blood pressure. \\n\\nSo, keep your LDL-C and total cholesterol low, blood pressure within the normal range, and especially, always keep your mind challenged, be it through formal education or through activities that push your mind around your purpose. \\nReference:\\n\\nAndrews et al., Annals of Neurology, September 29, 2020 \\n\\n#plantbased\\xa0#plantbaseddiet\\xa0#savetheplanet\\xa0#ecofriendly\\xa0#vegandiet\\xa0#veganlifestyle\\xa0#vegetarian\\xa0#flexitarian\\xa0#nomeat\\xa0#reducetarian\\xa0#plantbasednews\\xa0#pbn\\xa0#plantbasedhealth\\xa0#plantbasedfitness\\xa0#plantbasedlifestyle\\xa0#veganfood\\xa0#plantbasedfood\\xa0#dairyfree\\xa0#cleanmeat\\xa0#vegetarianism', 'Last month, you asked us to take a closer look at lab-grown meat.

But it was quickly revoked as it had a catastrophic effect on staple crops such as rice and tea. The ban contributed to worsening a serious economic crisis prompted by the pandemic. This month, the government had to default on its international debt repayments in order to buy essential food and supplies for its citizens.\\n\\n#2 A new report by Oxfam has revealed that corporations in the food sector have been posting record-high profits in the last two years, from the start of the pandemic. There are now 62 new food billionaires, while the Cargill family controls 70% of the global agricultural market. Last year, Cargill made the biggest profit in its history ($5 billion in net income).\\n\\n#3 A few days ago the first freight train with a load of grain left Ukraine and arrived in Lithuania via Poland. It is expected that one train carrying up to 1,500 tons of grain will depart from Ukraine every day, but this means that even in the best case scenario Ukrainians will be able to move only 20% of the quantity they would have been able to move were it not for the Russian Black Sea blockade.\\n\\n#4 Gene-edited tomatoes could soon be sold in England. A bill has been introduced this month to allow commercial growing of gene-edited crops in England.

It can also have some environmental benefits, even though these are hard to define.\\n\\nA local food system can contribute to rural development by creating more jobs or increasing the income for farmers and producers. These systems also lead to more interaction between producers and consumers, creating a sense of community. \\n\\nEnvironmental benefits are not as straightforward. To compare products from a local system to a conventional system the lifecycle analyses need to be comparable, which they currently aren't.

And the first cookie for cats that includes the cat‚Äôs native protein source ‚Äî mouse! And not a single mouse was harmed. \\n\\nUnderstandably, this has inspired a few questions as to why we started our cultured meat journey with a mouse cookie for cats instead of chicken, turkey or salmon, which are what most people typically buy for their cats. Here's our answer:\\n\\nCats evolved as predatory animals, with their food sources being mice, rats, rabbits, lizards and insects. Although chicken, beef and fish are the main sources of meat in pet foods, studies have shown that these proteins are also among the leading food allergens in cats and dogs. The only reason that kind of meat is included in pet food is because it‚Äôs the meat that humans want to eat and pet food consists of animal byproducts (50% of an animal that people don‚Äôt want to eat, which includes viscera, heads, bone, blood) and 4D meat (dead, diseased, dying and disabled) from the human food industry. \\n\\nSo, in growing cultured meat, we saw this as an ideal opportunity to create the protein source that is most evolutionarily appropriate for our pets, which is mouse for cats. Avoiding common food allergens also eliminates any incumbent health impacts, such as gastrointestinal and dermatological conditions.\\n\\nHarmless Hunt Mouse Cookies for Cats truly is the treat your cat was born to eat.\\n\\nLink in bio to pre-order!##\\n#becauseanimals #loveallanimals #culturedmeat\", \"On Today's episode of Snack Thoughts with Chirps, we ask the question: What's a better name for a cookie that's wafer-thick instead of wafer-thin?

Inside the $50 million facility, just outside #BerkeleyCalif., workers cultivate small clumps of #animalcells in large vats over two weeks, slowly growing them into #chickenbreasts and #steaks. No animal is slaughtered at any point in the process‚Äîthe flesh is #manufactured. At 53,000 square feet, the factory is the\\xa0largest ever dedicated\\xa0to so-called #cultivatedmeat; the company hopes consumers will be able to buy the meat it makes sometime in #2022.\\nUnlike #plantbasedmeat alternatives that have been on the market for years, cultivated meat is real meat. The techniques used to grow it are well developed; the problem for startups such as Upside is producing the meat in large quantities while achieving the smell, texture, and mouthfeel diners expect.\\n\\nUpside Foods‚Äô processing facility near Berkeley, Calif.\\n\\nSOURCE: UPSIDE FOODS\\n\\nAfter seven years of work, Upside says it‚Äôs ready to pump out as much as 50,000 pounds of food from the California plant. ‚ÄúWe want to be able to ship product from here nationally and then internationally,‚Äù says #UmaValeti, the chief executive officer and co-founder. He says Upside can make\\xa0just about any meat product, but it will focus first on things like #chickennuggets and chicken breasts and has already started production at the facility. When I tried an Upside chicken breast last year, it smelled and looked exactly like grilled chicken. It tasted like it, too, though the texture was a bit softer and less juicy.\\n\\nUpside Foods CEO Uma Valeti.\\n\\nSOURCE: UPSIDE FOODS\\n\\nMy taste test required me to sign a waiver. Before the public gets the same chance to try it, Upside needs a green light from U.S. regulators. Both the #FoodandDrugAdministration and the #DepartmentofAgriculture have spent three years figuring out how they‚Äôll monitor the cultivated #meatindustry, visiting laboratories and examining every process companies use to make their products.\\n\\nAlthough cultivated meat itself is considered safe, there are plenty of unanswered questions about how often the vats should be cleaned and how the meat should be transported and stored.', 'On average, meat consumption is highest across high-income countries - with the two highest meat consuming countries per capita being the U.S. and Australia as of 2017. Data also shows a strong relationship between GDP and increase in meat consumption: the more a country\\'s economic grows, the more its population tends to consume meat.  For example, for countries like China and Brazil that had undergone a strong economic transition, meat consumption has increased by 15-fold and 4-fold respectively since 1961. But this isn\\'t always the case, as we see with India: meat consumption is still less than 3.7 kg per capita (the same consumption since 1961). This may partially be due to the strong vegetarian cultural preferences.\\n\\nIn their Agricultural Outlook Report 2020-2029, @FAO and OECD project an increase of 12% in global meat consumption in the next decade. But, interestingly, they\\'ve also projected a decrease in meat consumption in the next few years \"in response to slower income growth in several regions, ageing populations, and a levelling off in per capita meat consumption in high-income countries as a result of saturation and dietary preferences for higher quality meats.\"\\n\\nGraphics by @cait__mack\\nSource: Our World in Data\\nFoodUnfolded is co-funded by @eiteu, a body of the EU üá™üá∫\\n\\n#foodunfolded #discoverfood #foodfacts #knowyourfood  #foodnetwork #foodchoices #foodquality #foodwatch\\n#knowwhatyoueat #consciouseating #foodquality #foodconversations #foodsystem #foodjusticeissocialjustice\\n#foodwaste #foodchain #farming #meat #vegetarian #vegan #meatconsumption', 'Who doesn‚Äôt love noodles?

Lasciate riposare l'impasto e intanto preparate il ripieno.\\nIn una padella fate rosolare aglio e olio, ci aggiungete i FUNGHI (quelli che preferite) finch√© perdono tutta l'acqua, salate e aggiungete qualche spezia, io ho messo un po' di TIMO, verso fine cottura aggiungete anche delle foglie di SPINACI freschi.\\nIn una padella tonda antiaderente fate scaldare un pochino d'olio, solo un velo, e quando √® calda versate due cucchiaiate di impasto circa e muovetelo fino a riempire l'intera superficie. Qui sarebbe molto utile avere l'aggeggio spargi impasto (nome tecnico non pervenuto) ma non ce l'avevo. Cuocete pochi minuti per lato fiamma abbastanza vivace e mettete poi insieme il tutto.

Food brings us together. Now, we don't want to kill all the joy, but there are numbers which we should probably know as we plan on cooking and buying food for the festivities. It's been estimated that Italians end up throwing away 500k tons of food around Christmas. That's the equivalent of the weight of 500 cargo ships, and it costs Italians around 80 euros per family. But Italy is not an exception. A survey conducted in the UK has shown that the cost of Christmas dinners has gone up by 14% in recent years. And in the UK, 5 million Christmas puddings, 2 million turkeys, and 74 million mince pies are wasted each year. Regardless of where we source our numbers from, Christmas food waste is a common problem everywhere: we buy in excess and we end up still eating Christmas meals in January. But the more perishable food ends up in the bin. Supermarket deals entice us to buy double or triple the amount of food that we need, or convince us that we need snowman-shaped chocolates. The question is: how big a sacrifice is it to resist that? Is there a better way to do food shopping and cooking for the festivities? We will publish some tips over the next few days, but let us know in the comments how you avoid wasting food on Christmas!

Food connects the personal to the planetary. Agriculture uses half the world‚Äôs habitable land and accounts for more than 30% of global emissions‚Ä¶ In the longer term the food system faces pressure from climate change, population growth and a shift towards more Westernised, meat-heavy diets.‚Äù\\n.\\nThose are only a few of the challenges facing the intensely complex, increasingly contentious global system of food production, according to The Economist in a Technology Quarterly devoted to the future of food, as the industry seeks to develop healthy, tasty, affordable and sustainable alternatives to the Anthropocene Diet.\\n.\\nThe good news is that those alternatives are within our sights, as The Economist explains by analysing the pros and cons of the dishes that already are being, or soon may be, produced by encouraging more of us to eat insects and seaweed, fresh seafood made thousands of miles from the nearest sea of ocean using inland saline aquaculture, cultivating yeast, making meat from plants or in labs, and growing fruit and vegetables in skyscrapers.

That‚Äôs not all, the total cost of diagnosed diabetes in the US is astronomical- $327 billion dollars! Imagine what could be done with that money for a condition that is largely preventable. This disease is striking a growing number of adults, and with the rising rates of childhood obesity, it has become more common in youth. The good news is that prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are largely preventable. About 9 in 10 cases in the US can be avoided by making lifestyle changes. Here are some simple steps to lower your risk and prevent type 2 diabetes. [CDC]\\u2060\\n\\u2060\\n1. Control your weight- excess weight is the single most important cause of type 2 diabetes. Being overweight or obese drastically increases the changes of developing diabetes.\\u2060\\n2. Get active physically- the more active you are the better. Spending less time sitting down and more time moving is going to be beneficial for your overall health. \\u2060\\n3. Eat a healthy diet- while what is ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù is deemed debatable to some, there are undeniably key pieces of a healthy diet. \\u2060\\n- Choose whole grains over refined grains and highly processed carbohydrates. \\u2060\\n- Skip the sugary drinks, and choose water instead. Avoid white rice, white bread, and white sugar.\\u2060\\n- Choose healthy fats- polyunsaturated fats found in nuts, seeds, and avocados instead of animal based fats can help reduce the risk of diabetes. Avoid trans fats and saturated fats. \\u2060\\n- Avoid red meat and processed meat. Choose nuts, beans, whole grains, poultry, or fish instead. Swapping out red meat or processed red meat for a healthier protein source, such as nuts, low-fat dairy, poultry, or fish, or for whole grains lowered diabetes risk by up to 35%. [Pan A. 2011.

But our relationship with marine foods is changing. Ocean supplies have reached their limits and in a few short decades, aquaculture has grown to provide over half of the seafood on our plates. But as it expands, so too does the need to improve the sustainability of its practices.\\n.\\nWe teamed up with the unitednation and hosted discussion groups between people from all across the food world (including NGOs, researchers, start-up companies, farmers, students and much more) to ask exactly what it will take to ensure the aquaculture industry doesn‚Äôt make the same mistakes as older problematic land based food producing industries. We settled on these calls-to-action for governments, researchers, innovators and producers - as well as some things that each and every one of us can make a difference by committing to.\\n.\\nDo you think taking these steps would make a positive impact on our food system?

It\\'s on 6/9/19. Info + free sign-up at www.techfestival.com\\n\"Tech is radically overhauling how we grow, transport, sell and consume food. Even what we conceive of as food. \\nIt offers the opportunity for more accountability, transparency and efficiency in the food supply chain; deeper insights into the senses that drive people‚Äôs culinary desires and choices; amplified personalisation and enjoyment of food experiences; and the power to help communities engage around healthier eating habits. But much of this technology looks set to push humans out of many key roles along the food chain and neglect the broader ecologies involved in food production, our relationships with wildlife and the planet. \\nWe\\'ll examine how to not just place people at the heart of food tech, but to accommodate human labor and intelligence and the complexity of multi species ecologies. From the breeding of seeds and the feeding of fields to the serving of meals, from the shipment of produce to the delivery of takeouts, and everything in between, how can we ensure that tech empowers, rather than displaces, humans from the food chain. How do we prioritise the joy of being human and the human intelligence needed for creating a regenerative food system that has integrity and discernment?\"\\n#techfest #futurefood #mybculinary #projectgastronomia #labedgl #gastrotech #berrikuntza #digitalgastronomy #LABe #LABedgl #LivingLab #entrepreneurship #futurefood #innovation #openinnovation #repost @labe.dgl #sansebastian #basquecountry', \"A solo exhibition of works by Erika Verzutti opens today at Fortes D'Aloia & Gabriel, S√£o Paulo.\\u2063\\u2063\\u2063\\n\\u2063\\u2063\\u2063\\nTitled 'Carne Sint√©tica [Cultured Meat]', the exhibition presents fifteen new wall-based works in bronze, papier-m√¢ch√© and clay.

So with a big smile I told everyone - including the farmer - that we must eat less beef! But guess what I‚Äôm eating in this picture‚Ä¶ üòÖ I need your advice.\\n\\nBeef is the meat with the highest CO2 footprint. Lots of scientific papers show the benefit of replacing beef with other food, even pork or chicken!\\n\\nThat‚Äôs why our number one advice to eat for the climate is: replace beef.\\n\\nBut only looking at the global averages doesn‚Äôt tell the full story. \\n\\nAt the Eemlandhoeve, the cows only eat grass and no pesticides or fertilisers are used to grow more food. This means the cows grow much slower and there‚Äôs a limit to how many cows they can have.\\n\\nWhen the cows move around, they stimulate the growth of grass, which then stores lots of CO2 underground. \\n\\nCows are not per definition bad for the climate, but we have way too many of them.\\n\\nSo in essence we need to replace all INDUSTRIAL beef. And then if we eat less meat overall, we can have better meat from farms where the animals are part of a healthy ecosystem.\\n\\n(this requires pasture-fed beef, not just 'grass-fed')\\n\\nThe issue for you and me, is that the ‚Äòpasture-fed meat‚Äô is not available at the supermarket and is hard to identify.\\n\\nThat‚Äôs why our advice is to ‚Äòeat less beef‚Äô.\\n\\nSometimes I struggle to find the balance between keeping it simple by saying ‚Äòeat less beef‚Äô and telling the whole story.\\n\\nWhat do you think? Does it make sense this way or do you find it confusing? \\n\\nHow do you deal with this? Do you prefer to go vegetarian or find ways to enjoy some 'good meat' in the weekend?\\n\\nI'd love to hear from you!\\n\\n--\\n\\nIf you want to learn more or find great meatless recipes, download the Fork Ranger app [iPhone, Dutch only] or visit our website at forkranger dot com\\n\\n#regenerativeagriculture #soilhealth #agroforestry #foodforest #ediblegardens #sustainablefood #sustainablefoods #futurefood #futureoffood #foodjustice #foodsecurity #growwhatyoueat #climatesolutions #sustainablefuture #sustainableliving #sustainabilitymatters #ourplanet #actonclimate #positivethinking #climatecommunication #foodsystem #farmerslife #agroecology #duurzaam #milieu\", 'What wife doesn‚Äôt like a shopping trip?

Enjoy, and if you could please SUBSCRIBE, SHARE and COMMENT it would be really appreciated.\\n\\nThe meat industry for as long as I can remember has always been a male dominated industry. This has been the case for a long time in my own businesses but 5 to 8 years ago I made the conscious decision to encourage, support, introduce and employ as many woman across my various businesses as possible. To the point that we know have a number of amazing and ultra talented butchers working for us and our production work force is now almost 30% female. I have found woman bring a certain level of finesse, calm, quality and attention to detail to what we do as a business. I am so very proud and appreciative of the courage these woman have shown to join what is a tough and demanding industry. Laura Ryan our latest guest on the Podcast is the Chair of Meat Business Women, a professional networking group for women working in the meat industry. Laura has a burning desire to develop the image, culture and landscape of the meat industry to make it more attractive to female talent, and nurture new female entrants into the sector through networking, education and mentoring. Tune in to this delightful, insightful and engaging young woman‚Äôs perspective and vision for the greater meat industry and the important role woman will continue to play. Enjoy.

I invited him to explain why the United Nations endorses edible insects to address food security and sustainability in the face of #climatechange and a growing world population. Edible insects are definitely a superfood. They‚Äôre super nutrient dense, and a whole lot of nutrition in a really small package. Edible insects contain high quality protein, vitamins and amino acids for humans. Insects have a high food conversion rate, e.g. crickets need six times less feed than cattle, four times less than sheep, and twice less than pigs and broiler chickens to produce the same amount of protein. Besides, they emit less greenhouse gases and ammonia than conventional livestock. Insects can be grown on organic waste in a smaller footprint. Therefore, insects are a potential source for conventional production (mini-livestock) of protein, either for direct human consumption, or indirectly in recomposed foods (with extracted protein from insects); and as a protein source into feedstock mixtures.

Jahrhunderts geh√∂rt neben dem Klimawandel ‚òÄÔ∏èdie Ern√§hrung üçû einer wachsenden Weltbev√∂lkerung. Ein Umdenken und Umstellen der konventionellen Nahrungsmittelproduktion ist eine gro√üe Aufgabe. Was kann angebaut werden und wo? Die Forschenden des Projekts CUBES Circle arbeiten an diesem Thema. Die Lebensmittelproduktion soll nachhaltiger und effizienter werden. Das CUBES System ist bisher einmalig, weil drei trophische Ebenen kreislauff√∂rmig verbunden üåê sind: Fisch üêü, Pflanzen üå±und Insekten ü¶ó. So wird beispielsweise das verwendete Fischwasser als Substrat f√ºr die Pflanzen verwendet. \\n\\nDabei r√ºckt der urbane Raum in den Fokus: Bis zu 40 Prozent der Lebensmittel k√∂nnten in den St√§dten üèôÔ∏è produziert werden: in Indoorfarmen, mit √ºbereinanderliegenden Pflanzenetagen und mit intelligenten Bew√§sserungsanlagen. Anbau ohne Sonne? Ja, auch das geht mittlerweile. Denn moderne Technologien wie LED üí° machen es m√∂glich. Forschende haben dies schon mit Basilikum und Pak Choi ü•ógetestet. \\n\\nSo k√∂nnte die Landwirtschaft der Zukunft aussehen. Um das System und die Vernetzung zu erforschen, entsteht der Standort des CUBES Circle in Berlin-Dahlem. Es wird jedoch noch einige Jahre dauern, bis die Technologie so reif, zug√§nglich und kosteneffizient ist, dass sie massenhaft eingesetzt wird. Mithilfe von Virtual und Augmented Reality  wird es verschiedene Nutzerstudien geben, um Fragen zu beantworten wie etwa: Wie w√ºrden AnwohnerInnen es finden, wenn ein CUBES-Modul bei ihnen in der Nachbarschaft üèòÔ∏è steht?\\n\\nüëâ Mehr Infos via Link in Bio\\n\\n#bio√∂konomie #foodfictions #dasistbio√∂konomie #umwelt #nachhaltigkeit #food #landwirtschaftderzukunft #landwirtschaft #ern√§hrung #anbau #essen #cubescircle #futurefood #agrarsystemederzukunft #horticulture #remoteCUBE #berlin #dahlem #steglitz #zehlendorf #food4future @cubescircle', 'Let‚Äôs just all take a moment to cherish the first Sirkkis Kebakkos of the Universe. #Sirkkis #Kebakko #Summerfood #Food #Foodporn #Delicious #Yummy #Yum #Grill #Grilled #EdibleInsects #Insectfood #Insektenessen #Foodstagram #Ruokakuva', 'Can you actually grill too much?

This waste can be used to feed insects which can be an environmentally sensible source of protein for humans, livestock, and aquaculture. Furthermore, invasive and agrarian insects are a largely untapped resource.

He has light dementia, so in the morning I bring him the newspaper and some sweet bread or ice cream, but of course stay two meters away from him. In the beginning I was feeling very depressed, eating comfort food like Spaghetti Bolognese, lots of cheese and chocolates to make myself feel better. I cried every day for a week because I was worried about my son, who lives in the UK. The tactic that Boris Johnson and his government employed left me very unsettled and I made myself a rice-milk pudding with Ceylon cinnamon every night. That was very comforting. Now, spending all my money, I send flour, masks and gloves to my son in London. He has to make his own bread and pastry but can‚Äôt find flour since everybody started doing this. He donates the masks to people who work for the NHS. Since I can‚Äôt be there, I need to feel like I am doing something for him at least.‚Äù Notina, Athens, Greece\\n\\n#foodunfolded #whatthefact #agriculture #innovation #farming #quarantinestories #socialinitiatives #covid #togetherwecan #togetherwearestronger #shoplocal #localbusiness #smallbusiness #supportyourlocal', 'üå±Selvom livet i Aarhus er anderledes for tiden arbejder vi stadig h√•rdt p√• at lave nogle velsmagende f√¶rdigretter med insektprotein til jer i @bug_amok ! ‚úä‚úä\\nDen l√¶nge ventede Bugottoüòç (risotto med lokale r√•varer) ser snart dagens lys i FOODLAB og for at hj√¶lpe til er @Trine H√∏jgaard nu blevet en del af BUG AMOK.\\nüêõ \\nVelkommen til!

This Wild Crabapple Tree (Malus toringoides) is showing off its fruits.\\n.\\nThe Garden has a few species of crabapple. The fruits are edible, but perhaps more interestingly, these wild species can be crossbred or used as rootstock to make domestic apples more resistant to pests and the cold.\\n.\\nHave you ever been in an orchard and noticed a gnarled belt of bark about 6-12 inches off the ground. This is where one species of tree was grafted to the roots of another and the two trees became one. The rootstock is usually closely related to the tree above - generally the same species or genus.\\n.\\nAs our global climate continues to change, rootstock and hybridization of wild and agricultural plants may become even more essential for our future food security. The Garden creates a protected space for these wild genetics to thrive while providing opportunities for future research.\\n.\\nAs a living museum, we ask that you do not eat or collect any material from the Garden.

There was forest all around our town, but as I started looking on Google Earth, I discovered that there was always another village waiting on the other side. ‚†Ä\\nI realise that most of the area is farmland and the forest is more like a park in between the fields. How did I never see this? I zoom out, looking at Europe and see tiny patches of dark green. Curious, I zoom in on other areas of Germany. Then France and Spain. Everywhere I look, it‚Äôs the same: some roads and villages surrounded by fields. I randomly swing my mouse to the south of Russia and zoom in: fields. Then the US, Brazil, India, Australia, Zambia.‚†Ä\\nEverywhere I look, I can spot the fields of agriculture. I‚Äôm staring at my screen with an open mouth.‚†Ä\\nThis changes everything.

Mi hanno molto colpito le sue affermazioni pronunciate in occasione del \"The World\\'s 50 Best Restaurants\" ad Anversa perch√© sono risultate molto pi√π oneste e coraggiose di quelle pronunciate da gran parte della politica. Di fronte alle critiche ricevute per avere convertito il suo menu in chiave 100% plant-based, Humm risponde che quello che sta cercando di fare va ben oltre il ricevere critiche acclamanti, si tratta di fare qualcosa per il pianeta e di farlo subito, parlare anche solo di sostenibilit√† adesso √® troppo tardi, tutto √® cambiato e per questo servono dei ripensamenti radicali, pensare ancora al caviale per esempio come qualcosa di prezioso √® fuori dal tempo. Spera anche che la sua scelta possa ispirare tanti altri chef a fare lo stesso ed √® quello che ci auguriamo anche noi. Nel frattempo perch√© non sognare un po\\' andando a sbirciare i piatti di quelli che negli ultimi anni sono stati ritenuti tra i migliori ristoranti green al mondo?

Insects an edible field guide, by Stefan Gates. Published 2017.\\n\\nI said that 1998 was a big year for books about edible insects. But it's nothing compared to 2017, the year when a lot of publishing houses decided that a book on edible insects could be a hit. I have six books from that year, and I think there are some books in German, a cookbook in Danish and a Spanish book I never bought. But Stefan Gates' small, and really handy field guide was a definite buy. The british ‚Äúgastronaut‚Äù Stefan Gates @gastronautlab has spent quite a lot of time, especially on TV eating insects. In this book he helps everyone who wants to collect edible insects. Just pick the chapter about your part of the world and find your local culinary alternatives. The guide is fun, informative and has beautiful illustrations made by Candela Riveros. One suggestion in the book that I don‚Äôt think I will ever try is collecting midges and making African Kunga cakes out of them. We have a lot of midges in Sweden, but I can't help thinking about the fact that they feed on human blood... \\n\\nFind more books in:\\n#bugburgersbookparade\\u2060\\n\\n#eatinsects #edibleinsects #entomophagy (hate that word) #books\", 'Visit Bugburger.se and read my latest blog post.

That‚Äôs the equivalent to the amount devoured by 26 million Americans, and it makes U.S. cats and dogs equal to the fifth largest country in terms of animal protein consumption. Yet the impact pet food has on the environment and climate change, how healthy or necessary it is for our animal companions, or how it impacts the welfare of the farmed animals who become that food are barely known or ignored‚Äïeven by animal lovers! The Clean Pet Food Revolution lifts the lid on the current pet food industry: its claims of what constitutes a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù diet for pets, its shocking record on animal welfare, and its devastating effect on the environment and climate change. The book explodes myths about ‚Äúgrain-free‚Äù diets, protein intake, and what our pets ‚Äúwant.‚Äù Finally, it details the many exciting scientific developments in alternative proteins‚Äïwhether from plants, fungi, insects, or cell-based meat products‚Äïthat promise not only to completely change what we feed our cats and dogs but to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, end farmed-animal slaughter, and make our pets healthier. Written by specialists in veterinary science, biotech, and animal welfare, The Clean Pet Food Revolution is a thoroughly researched and compellingly written excoriation of an unsustainable present and a fascinating glimpse of future possibilities. #veterinary #veterinarian #dvm #vmd #veterinarymedicine #vetmed #veterinaria #vettech #vetlife #vettechlife #vetstudentlife #vettechproblems #vettechstudent #vetschool #cvt #lvt #rvt #cvpm #dogs #petfood #vegan #vegetarian #plantbased #futurefood #book', '@Maxvic_Frutossecos te ofrece meriendas saludables.

In fact, corn infested with corn #earworm sold for more money than ears without the #caterpillars.\\n\\nToday there are nearly 2,000 #EdibleInsectSpecies, each with distinctive qualities, textures and flavors. Insects are versatile‚Äîthey can be baked, fried, pureed, ground into flour and turned into salts. They can be added to savory dishes, baked into sweets or even stirred into a cocktail. #Beetles and their larvae (#mealworms and #BuffaloWorms) top the list as most popular, followed by #caterpillars, bees/wasps, #ants, #crickets and #grasshoppers.\\n\\nBut just because we can, should we? For the last decade, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization has championed #insects as the most viable alternative source of protein to meat because of their ecological friendliness.\\n\\nMany #insect species are rich in protein and good fats, as well as high in calcium, iron and zinc. Farm-raised crickets can contain double the amount of protein in chicken, more calcium than milk and more iron than spinach.\\n\\nInsects also have environmental advantages. They emit considerably less greenhouse gases than most livestock (especially cattle), don‚Äôt generate large quantities of waste that can pollute rivers and lakes, and require a tiny fraction of the freshwater pigs and cows need to survive. \\n\\nWhile we might not have persuaded you to enjoy an insect-filled meal today‚Äîalthough if you‚Äôre giving bugs the taste test for the 1st time, why not do it when they're covered in #chocolate‚Äîhopefully we‚Äôve done what we always try to do: make you #QuestionYourWorld.\\n\\n#science #ChocolateCoveredInsects #rva\", 'My edible insect book parade (books in chronological order from my bookshelf):\\u2060\\n\\nBook #17. Insects as Food and Feed - from production to consumption. Edited by Arnold van Huis and Jeffery K. Tomberlin. Published 2017.\\n\\nThis might be the most ‚Äúserious‚Äù book in my collection. It is in many ways a follow up to the FAO report, a guide book for a new industry. It‚Äôs published by Wageningen Academic Publishers and edited by Arnold van Huis (the semi-god of insect eating research) and Jeffrey K. Tomberlin. The book is a collection of scientific articles that covers everything a modern insect farmer needs. It explains (I quote) ‚Äúlarge scale and small scale production, facility design, the management of diseases, and how to assure that the insects will be of high quality (genetics). The nutrient content of insects will be discussed and how this is influenced by life stage, diet, the environment and processing. Technological processing requires decontamination, preservation, and ensuring microbial safety. The prevention of health risks (e.g. allergies) will be discussed as well as labelling, certification and legislative frameworks. Additional issues are: insect welfare, the creation of an enabling environment, how to deal with consumers, gastronomy and marketing strategies.‚Äù\\n\\nYes it is a seriously good book for every upcoming entopreneur.

Go for smart snacks that are rich in vitamins, minerals, complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats. For example, combine our delicious Pea Cricket Protein Chips with guacamole and some fresh veggies. A great healthy combo without the empty calories. \\n---\\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Go nuts - Go for the unsalted nuts and seeds in a hand full portion to add some nutrients and healthy fats. Almonds, walnuts, peanuts, roasted pumpkin seeds, cashews, hazelnuts... which one do you like the most? \\n---\\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Snack mindfully - Avoid eating while doing something else at the same time. Take some minutes off of your busy routine to give yourself a break and enjoy your snack calmly. You will feel more satiated and full of energy. \\n---\\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Pack snacks to go - Hungry at work and going to the spending machine to grab something to enjoy with your coffee? Does it sound familiar? Avoid the junk trap by having at hand, some planned healthy alternatives like our #pleasurebars. \\n--- \\n5Ô∏è‚É£ Make the easier choice accessible: Avoid buying junk food, if you have it you will eat it.

Let me explain: ‚†Ä\\n‚†Ä\\nAnimals can eat leftover products like peels and grass.  In that way, they don‚Äôt compete with the land that can be used to grow food for humans.‚†Ä\\n‚†Ä\\nBut the amount of meat you can get from this system is limited. If you want to eat more meat, you have to feed the extra animals with grain and other food that is specifically grown for them.‚†Ä\\n‚†Ä\\nAnd that is where the trouble begins. ‚†Ä\\n‚†Ä\\nIt‚Äôs pathetic to feed grain to animals while there are plenty of humans who don‚Äôt get enough food. But it‚Äôs not only unfair, it also causes huge environmental damage because it‚Äôs not efficient. Getting the same amount of calories from grain-fed animals needs way more land than if you would grow crops for human consumption.‚†Ä\\n‚†Ä\\nThat‚Äôs the current situation. But what this graph shows is that reducing our meat consumption by 50%, reduces the impact by much MORE than 50%. Eating half as much meat makes already makes a HUGE difference.‚†Ä\\n‚†Ä\\nEating half as much meat is still going to be a challenge, but it‚Äôs far from impossible. This is a goal that we can reach.

Sotto trovate per esempio come sostituire le uova nei dolci, come assumere B12 e omega 3, le fonti di proteine migliori nel regno vegetale, i differenti tipi di cereali e oggi tocca al calcio. Sono stata ispirata dalla newsletter di #veganuary che un po' di giorni fa parlava proprio di questo minerale molto importante per la nostra salute. Come per gli altri micronutrienti, anche per quanto riguarda il calcio non vi verr√† a mancare nulla seguendo una dieta vegetale se saprete introdurvi una variet√† sufficiente di elementi il cui mix dar√† naturalmente al nostro corpo tutto quello che gli serve per stare bene. Inoltre, come scrivono nella newsletter, √® pi√π facile assorbire calcio da fonti vegetali piuttosto che dal latte vaccino. Molti studi dimostrano che solo il 30% del calcio che si trova in una tazza di latte di mucca √® effettivamente assorbito dal nostro corpo, al contrario di quello che si trova, per esempio, nel cavolo nero che √® direttamente assorbibile al 50% - 60% .\\nProprio con il tofu, ho intenzione di preparare a breve una ricetta semplicissima, ma di grande effetto... a dessert \\nStay tuned!\\n#veganuary2022 #vegantips #veganfortheanimals #veganlove #veganitalia #vegancommunity #calcio #veganism #veganlife #sustainability #healthyliving #vegandaily #vegansofig #vegansofinstagram #igvegan #veganfortheplanet #ideeincucina #veganlover #foodofthefuture #futurefood #menuvegano #veganideas #cucinarevegano #veganhomecook #vegansofig #italianvegantribe #italianveganfood #foodie #foodfeed #foodworld\", 'Ab sofort gibt es die beliebte regionale Spezialit√§t auch im Glas. \\nMit viel Leidenschaft gez√ºchtet, verarbeitet und verpackt. \\n\\nAb sofort erh√§ltlich aus dem K√ºhlregal.\\n\\n#weinbergschnecken #escargot #frisch #futurefood #wilderkaiser #gourmet #lebengenie√üen #kaiserschnecke #schneckenzucht #snail #escargot #snailfarming #nachhaltig #sustainable #nature #gourmet #klimatarier #schneckeimglas #qualitaÃàtbrauchtzeit #gourmetfood #quality #ellmau #austria #kulturtirol #ellmauamwildenkaiser #slowfood #culturefood #slowfoodmovement #slowvibes #lovetirol @kaufmann_spirits @weinatelier_agnes', 'Yummy yummy!

In 2014, a year after the FAO report that created a lot of interest, she released her book ‚ÄúEdible‚Äù which even as part of the title claimed that eating insects was ‚Äúthe last great hope to save the planet‚Äù.\\xa0\\n\\nIn the book we follow her personal journey from discovering edible insects in Mexico, buying @thebugchef and Julieta Ramos-Elorduy‚Äôs books (see my earlier posts), experimenting with cooking insects herself and then traveling around the world meeting with advocates and chefs. She meets the early entopreneurs Monica Martinez @donbugito, Pat Crowley @chapulrevolution, she goes to Copenhagen and the famous gourmet restaurant Noma, and meets the guys at Nordic Foodlab (that later made the film Bugs and the book On insects (that I will cover in another Instagram post), then to Japan visiting the insect meetups in Tokyo (I told you about two days ago), and ends up meeting Marcel Dicke.

Published 1975.\\n\\nOne of the pioneers in promoting eating edible insects in the west is an entomologist, pathologist and biologist: Ronald L. Taylor. In 1975 he made a splash with this book (with a wonderful 70‚Äôs orange-yellow-brown cover).\\nRonald makes all the arguments we make today for eating insects, but when the big overwhelming topic today is man made climate change, the talk of the 70‚Äôs was hunger, food scarcity and the protein crises. Ronald saw protein rich insects as a solution and is quite convincing. I think he also was first when pointing out that we already unconsciously eat insects via the vegetables and processed food we eat. There are no pure vegetarians, claims Ronald, as all vegetarians also eat insects. üòä\\n\\nThe book takes the topic of insect eating seriously (with practical guides on how to collect, buy and cook), but to make it a bit more palatable the publisher hired an illustrator, John Gregory Tweed, who made funny illustrations commenting each chapter. This makes the book a bit cheesy‚Ä¶ but also charming.\\n\\nIn 1976 Ronald together with Barbara J. Carter followed up with a cooking book called: ‚ÄúEntertaining With Insects, Or: The Original Guide to Insect Cookery‚Äù, which I understand is really entertaining, with even more illustrations.

They taste better (same reason as above)‚†Ä\\n3. They are often more sustainable: packaging is always a tiny part of food product's impact. Also, it costs a lot more energy to grow tomatoes in a greenhouse in January than to package them in Italy during summer and transport them to the Netherlands.‚†Ä\\n‚†Ä\\nSustainable food is often not intuitive.‚†Ä\\n‚†Ä\\nIf you've seen my YouTube video about canned tomatoes you know there is one more issue to talk about.

Every couple of months they sell the meat of a slaughtered cow to their customers. One cow per month doesn't feed a whole lot of people.

You may have seen them before in mezcal bottles, as sometimes producers add them to infuse their unique flavor. Chinicuiles are considered a culinary delicacy in Mexico, dating as far back as pre-columbian times. It‚Äôs very rare to find these little creatures alive in markets, as they‚Äôre often sold already cooked. To keep them alive, they‚Äôre stored in plastic containers and fed tortillas. Then, when ready to be prepared, they‚Äôre roasted directly on a comal or flat griddle with a tiny amount of oil and served up in a taco with salsa. Their savory flavor and crunchy texture is often compared to chicharr√≥n or pork rinds.\\u2060\\n\\u2060\\n#eatmexico #mexicocity #snacktime #eatmexicotours #travel #foodtours #marketstalls #cdmx #mexicocityfood #mezcal #edibleinsects', 'Are you curious about cultured meat?\\n\\nWe‚Äôre making cultured meat for your pets!

Dr Julieta is one of the authorities on edible insects, and was very active in this field until her retirement in 2015. That a Mexican scholar would become an expert on edible insects isn‚Äôt strange at all as Mexico is one of the countries with the most developed tradition of eating insects. It‚Äôs said that over 500 species of insects are collected and eaten in Mexico. These are old Mayan and Aztech traditions that have survived the arrival of the conquistadors. Like many other cookbooks in the genre Julieta starts out with a lesson about edible insects before giving us 62 recipes, many with an Mexican twist.

Over the course of the next three years, one #Dutch company will try to move its meat product from the laboratory to your table.\\n\\n#MosaMeat produced a #labgrownbeef burger five years ago.  The company announced Tuesday it has received the funding to make and sell artificially grown meat to restaurants as early as 2021, according to The Associated Press. \\nThe #artificialmeat will be ground beef for burgers with the typical hamburger patty costing around $1. \\nMosa Meat says its biggest challenge is making meat that looks, feels and tastes like the real thing.  In the process, the company uses a small sample of cells taken from a live animal.\\n\\nThe cells are fed nutrients and are engineered to grow into strands of muscle tissue.  The company claims it can make up to the equivalent of 80,000 quarter pounders from a single sample. \"Theoretically from one little piece of meat you can create an unlimited amount,\" Mike Selden, CEO of #FinlessFoods told Wired Magazine back in February of this year.\\n\\nBut is it more cost-effective than raising #livestock? \\nThe magazine reports one of the few studies that has been done on the environmental impact of the new meat found that companies would actually end up using more energy to produce #labgrownmeat than you would be raising cows. \\nThe AP also reports there will be plenty of competition.  There are already a number of startups and established meat companies who hope to cash in on the \"cultured\" meat market.\\n\\nThere\\'s already a battle brewing over what to call the product.  Some advocates suggest the term \"clean meat\" while farmers say the term \"synthetic meat\" is more accurate. \\nAs Matt Simon in his Wired Magazine article points out, \"the challenges of engineering meat in the lab is one thing, but convincing consumers to turn away from the storied kill-it-and-grill-it method of eating is another.\" ( Via @freedom_faction )', 'Our crunchy roasted grasshoppers dipped in delicious dark chocolate...

They explain that ‚Äúdisgust is one of the six fundamental human emotions. While the emotion is universal, the foods that we find disgusting are not.‚Äù\\n.\\nIdeas of disgust are individual, contextual, and cultural, and can change over time. For example, in the 17th century, lobsters were used as fish bait and fed to the poor, slaves, or prisoners. There was even a law that prohibited serving lobsters more than twice a week to prisoners üòÇ\\n.\\nAnother example I‚Äôm still thinking over and over again is Ortolan. It‚Äôs a small bird that eats in dark. Once captured, a bird was taken to a dark cage with lots of food so that it would eat non-stop. Then the bird was drowned in brandy and cooked. When eating the bird, people covered their head with a napkin so that the God wouldn‚Äôt see them! Now it is prohibited in the EU, but apparently the eating experience of this bird is described as ‚Äúclose to ecstasy‚Äù and some French chefs are lobbying to bring it back on the table\\n.\\nAt the end of the exhibition, they let you taste some food such as cheese with visible tiny worms, Vegemite, and insects. They cleverly designed the whole thing - you start with a small thin insect and you move up to a relatively big and round one.

I just got a delivery from a second hand bookstore in the USA and can now add another book to my #bugburgersbookparade. Ronald L. Taylor and Barbera J. Carters \"Entertaining with Insects\" from 1976 (my book seems to be a reprint from 1992). It is a really wonderful cook book with beautiful illustrations. I like that they have set up basic recipes on preparing roasted insects, insect broth, etc and organising the book in different chapters according to the occasion. Will you serve breakfast? Lunch? Dinner? Cocktail party? Brunch? Etc. And it is even more specific: do you want to celebrate Mardi Gras? Indian Independence Day?

He started ‚ÄúKonchu Ryori Kenkyukai‚Äù that translated to English means something like ‚ÄúThe insect food research society‚Äù. Since 1999 he and his followers have met about once a month at a caf√© in Tokyo where they have tried cooking with different insects. Not just traditional Japanese food insects like bee larvae or crickets, but everything they could find that seemed edible. This book came in 2013, following up on the FAO report. I don‚Äôt read Japanese, but I think the beginning of the book references a lot to the report. The rest is a beautiful and practical field guide with photos of edible insects, how to find them and how to cook and prepare them.\\n\\nI wish I could read Japanese.

My answer: The written language.\\xa0\\n\\nIf you look further down the list you find the Internet and‚Ä¶ in many ways its precursor, the Library!\\xa0\\n\\nI have always loved libraires. I love the concept of collecting human knowledge and stories and lending it out for free. That is why I am so glad that my Swedish book about eating insects (‚Äú√Ñta insekter‚Äù) has found its way to so many libraries. Everytime I get an email from a student with questions (this week it has happened twice) I reply, but also suggest that they can borrow the book or buy it. Yesterday I even looked up where a student could borrow it and discovered that you can find my book at 72 libraries around Sweden.\\n\\nBut you can not find an ebook version of ‚Äú√Ñta insekter‚Äù and only the 10.5 million people around the world that master the Swedish language can appreciate the book.\\n\\nLately I have been thinking about writing an updated version in English. A version that can be downloaded as an ebook and borrowed from libraries, all around the world.\\n\\nGood idea? Or not? Maybe a printed English version? Maybe people are longing for another printed book about eating insects in English? The perfect 2021 Christmas gift? :)\\n\\n(Photo: A collection of Instagram posts from @ostbergakulturhus_bibliotek\\n, @bodens.stadsbibliotek , @krstadbibbla and @sotenasbiblioteken)\\n\\n#libraries #books #eatinsects #edibleinsects #entomophagy #futureprotein #foodie', \"My edible insect book parade (books in chronological order from my bookshelf):\\u2060\\n\\nBook #14. Insekter p√• menuen - den nye trend i Europa, by Nina Askov. Published 2017.\\n\\nDanish Nina Askov @ninaaskov started her blog Buglady.dk in 2014, the same year I started Bugburger.se in Sweden. For a couple of years she was a really active edible insect advocate, doing a lot of cooking, visiting companies, markets and schools holding lectures and serving edible insects. In 2017, at the height of her Buglady career, she released this book in Danish. Just like Daniella Martin's book you follow Nina‚Äôs journey from discovering edible insects (in Nina‚Äôs case eating an ant) to becoming a self-taught insect chef and advocate. The book gives you 20 recipes and a lot of short articles that when I am reading the book 2021 feels like discovering a Danish time capsule. Here we meet Danish entopreneurs: Mike Erikstrup at @dininsektbutik, Jakob Rukov at @buggingdenmark.dk and the guys at @heimdal.entofarm. She also makes a trip abroad and meets Shami Radia from @eatgrubofficial, Christine Spliid (who was one of the European cricket protein bar pioneers with Crobar (RIP)), Marjin Lanting from @krecafood and Luc Deleersnyder from Belgian Deli-Ostrich. The interview with Luc is really interesting as his company at the time sold frozen grasshoppers, mealworms, buffalo worms and wax moth larvae in a couple of countries in Europe! He believed that dry insects couldn‚Äôt compare with blanched frozen ones, and I think he was right. Unfortunately Deli-Ostrich nowadays only sells frozen mealworms and grasshoppers. Wax moth larvae is forbidden as food in the whole of Europe as nobody has made a novel food application.\\n\\nAnd unfortunately Nina Askov has also left the business, or at least put her career as ‚ÄúThe Buglady'' on pause. This according to a blogpost in September 2020. Six years after starting her advocacy.\\n\\nFind more books in:\\n#bugburgersbookparade\\u2060\\n\\n#eatinsects #edibleinsects #entomophagy (hate that word) #books\", 'Planning my book-release talk. 10 visions...\\n#futurefood #futureprotein #edibleinsects #eatinsects', 'Somthing new in @restoranasgrey !

It goes by many names, including clean, cultured, engineered, in-vitro, and vat-grown meat. Here‚Äôs how the process works: Stem cells are taken from the muscle of an animal, usually with a small biopsy under anesthesia, then they‚Äôre put with nutrients, salts, pH buffers, and growth factor and left to multiply. \\n\\n Companies that make the meat prefer to call it ‚Äúclean meat‚Äù to emphasize the idea that it may be more environmentally friendly. Cultured meat is said to have advantages over normal meat in that it is technically vegan(no animal is hurt in the process), requires less resources to manufacture and is better for the environment. \\n\\nMemphis Meats now plans to build a pilot production facility, thanks to additional investments in January this year from Cargill and Tyson Foods, as well as high-profile investors Bill Gates, Richard Branson, and Kimbal Musk. #labgrownmeat #culturedmeat #stopkillinganimals #newfor2021 #nonmeateater #noanimalsharmed #labgrown #meateaters #meateater #thenextcomeup #billgates #richardbranson #kimbalmusk #mosa #labgrownfood #hungryhungry #readytoeat #foodnews #newinventions #wouldyoueatthis', \"<3 this post if YOU'RE READY FOR 2021 TO START!!!

We'll discuss how Singapore became the first country in the world to regulate #cellag (aka #culturedmeat) for human consumption and what that could mean for the rest of the world. We'll hear from @shiokmeats @turtletreelabs @bigideaventures_ and more about #foodsafety and how they plan to drive consumers to try out #cleanmeat.

She is a super inspiring woman and was just named one of Forbes' #30under30. Biomilq is applying stem cell technology (commonly used in #cellag) to create custom breast milk from mammalian cells, regardless of gender, age, or even species. So yes, in the future we may have man's milk or father's milk, in addition to mother's milk as an option for babies. Their goal is not to replace mother's milk but to give families an alternative to formula that can be customized to your own body. How cool is that?!? While Biomilq is still a few years away from market, they are actively engaging with moms on this topic so that when they're ready to launch, they can help families make empowered, informed choices about the best way to feed their children. And they're also finding ways to ensure their end product is inclusive for moms at all income levels. Check out the podcast and share your thoughts on this wild technology!

For the most part, meat alternatives are plant-based ingredients that impart a texture, taste, look, smell and/or nutritional quality that resembles the meat-based product being replaced.\\n\\nThe cultured meat we are growing is 100% meat. Our cells are fed the same nutrients that cells growing inside of an animal receive - vitamins, minerals and amino acids. Whether those animal cells are growing inside or outside of the whole animal, the nutritional needs of those cells are the same. Among the biggest differences between cultured meat and animal-grown meat is the source of those nutrients: rather than nutrients coming from within the animal, the nutrients used in Because, Animals‚Äô cultured meat come from plant and microbial sources.\\n#loveallanimals\\n#becauseanimals\\n#culturedmeat', '\"The cultivated meat industry is nearing its tipping point.
